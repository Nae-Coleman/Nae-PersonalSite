            Hello! My name is Teranae but you can call me Nae! I am currently on
            the road to becoming a software engineer, driven by a passion for
            technology and continuous learning. My background has given me
            valuable experience in leadership, problem-solving, and teamwork.
            Before pursuing software development, I worked as a registered
            veterinary technician, where I served as a head tech, and also as a
            home health aide—roles that strengthened my ability to adapt,
            communicate effectively, and approach challenges with patience and
            precision. These experiences have shaped me into a dedicated,
            detail-oriented individual who's eager to apply these skills in the
            world of software engineering.
          </p>
