        <p class="intro">
          Outside of work, I enjoy traveling and exploring new destinations that
          inspire relaxation and creativity. I also take pride in maintaining
          and improving my home, always finding productive ways to enhance my
          surroundings. Above all, I devote my time to being a dedicated mother,
          balancing family life with purpose, care, and commitment.

        <p class="vacayintro">
          When I do get some time for myself, I love taking vacations to relax,
          recharge, and explore new places. Traveling gives me the chance to
          reset, reflect, and come back home refreshed—ready to keep giving my
          best to my family.

        <h2 class="builder">DIY enthusiast</h2>
        <p class="builderintro">
          I’m a proud mother who loves getting hands-on, whether it’s fixing
          cars or tackling home improvement projects. There’s something
          satisfying about problem-solving and seeing a project through from
          start to finish, and I enjoy sharing that energy with my family.
          Balancing motherhood with my DIY and mechanical hobbies keeps life
          exciting, rewarding, and full of learning every day.
